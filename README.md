<h4>Introduction</h4>

This is a training project. I'd like to answer the question "Can you describe the vibe of Airibn listing using listing user-generated comments?" with my research. The goal of this exercise is to utilise user - generated content to build a short description for each property and to visualise it on a map.

<h4>Technologies</h4>

I used 3.6 and Jupyter Notebooks for this research project.
There are few libraries that are needed to be installed in order to work with the notebook
 - Numpy <br>
 - Pandas<br>
 - Counter (from collections import Counter)<br>
 - NLTK <br>
 - Folium<br>
 - Plotly<br>
<br>

## Setup
To run this project, install the following libraries:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter
import datetime as dt
import nltk
from nltk import ngrams
import folium
import plotly.graph_objects as go
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

<h4>Project Motivation and Content: </h4>

  I'd like to answer the following questions in my research:<br> <br>
- "Can you describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?"<br>
- "Is there a correlation between a number of reviews and average rating?"<br>
- "What kind of review component correlate most with an overal rating?"<br>

The repository contains only one file - Jupyter notebook covers all the process from data extraction to modelling and visualisation.

<h4>Results</h4>
