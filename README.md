<h2>Context:</h2>

I'd like to answer the question "Can you describe the vibe of Airibn listing using listing user-generated comments?" with my research. The goal of this exercise is to utilise user - generated content to build a short description for each property and to visualise it on a map.

<h4>Installations</h4>
There are few libraries that are needed to be installed in order to work with the notebook
pandas (import pandas as pd)<br>
numpy (import numpy as np)<br>
Counter (from collections import Counter)<br>
NLTK (import nltk)<br>
folium (import folium)<br>
plotly import plotly.graph_objects as go<br>
<br>
<h4>Project Motivation and content: </h4>

  I'd like to answer the following questions in my research:<br> <br>
- "Can you describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?"<br>
- "Is there a correlation between a number of reviews and average rating?"<br>
- "What kind of review component correlate most with an overal rating?"<br>

The repository contains only one file - Jupyter notebook covers all the process from data extraction to modelling and visualisation.
